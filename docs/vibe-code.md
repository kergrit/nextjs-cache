# Vibe Code - Next.js Cache Project

## Current Status
- Fixed all API calls to use cachedFetch() with Next.js Data Cache
- Added volume mount in docker-compose.yml for persistent cache
- Docker container needs rebuild to apply changes

## Issue Found
1. Docker container is running old code (needs rebuild)
2. Permission denied error when creating cache directory

## Solution Applied
1. ✅ Changed all `fetch()` calls to `cachedFetch(url, revalidate)`
2. ✅ Added volume mount: `nextjs-cache-data:/app/.next/cache`
3. ✅ Fixed permissions by creating cache directory before switching to nextjs user
4. ⏳ Ready to rebuild when network is stable

## To Fix Cache Issue
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

## Key Learnings
- Next.js Data Cache persists in `.next/cache` folder
- Docker needs volume mount to persist cache across restarts
- Need to rebuild to apply code changes

## Performance
- Dev: http://localhost:3000 ✅ Working
- Docker: http://localhost:3003 ⚠️ Needs rebuild

## Latest Fix: Dynamic Rendering for Accurate Timings

**Issue**: Total page load time showing same value because Next.js was caching the static page

**Solution**: Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to pages with API calls:
- ✅ `/inactive-cache` - Force dynamic + revalidate 0
- ✅ `/active-cache` - Force dynamic + revalidate 60  
- ✅ `/comparison` - Force dynamic + revalidate 0
- ❌ `/` (home) - Not needed (no API calls, just navigation links)

Now timings will vary based on actual API response times.
