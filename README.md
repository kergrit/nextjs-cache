# Next.js Cache Performance Demo

## üêõ Current Issue: Cache Not Working in Docker

### Problem
- Docker container is running old code without `cachedFetch()`
- Many APIs show cache misses on every request
- Next.js Data Cache is not being used

### Solution: Rebuild Docker Container

The code has been updated but the container needs to be rebuilt:

```bash
# Stop and remove old container
docker-compose down

# Rebuild with new code
docker-compose build --no-cache

# Start container
docker-compose up -d

# Check logs
docker-compose logs -f nextjs-cache
```

### What Was Fixed

1. ‚úÖ All API calls now use `cachedFetch(url, revalidate)`
2. ‚úÖ Added cache directory permissions in Dockerfile
3. ‚úÖ Added volume mount for persistent cache
4. ‚è≥ Needs rebuild to apply changes

### Expected Behavior After Rebuild

**First Request:**
- All APIs: Cache MISS
- Load time: ~400-900ms per API

**Second Request (within TTL):**
- All APIs: Cache HIT  
- Load time: ~0-5ms

### Verify Cache is Working

Check logs for these patterns:
```
‚úÖ Good: Cache HIT for jsonplaceholder-posts: 0ms
‚ùå Bad: Cache MISS for jsonplaceholder-posts
```

## Local Development

```bash
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000/active-cache
```

## Docker Deployment

```bash
docker-compose up -d
# Visit http://localhost:3003/active-cache
```

## Architecture

- **Phase 1** (`/inactive-cache`): Direct API calls, no caching
- **Phase 2** (`/active-cache`): Next.js 16 fetch cache with revalidation
- **Phase 3** (`/full-route-cache`): Full Route Cache with ISR (Static Generation)
- **Comparison** (`/comparison`): Side-by-side performance comparison of all 3 phases

## Cache Strategy

Uses Next.js Data Cache with `fetch(url, { next: { revalidate: seconds } })`:
- Persists across requests in `.next/cache` folder
- Works in standalone Docker deployment
- Automatic revalidation based on TTL
